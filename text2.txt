Yes, a lambda function in Python can have multiple arguments. You can define multiple arguments
in a lambda function just as you would in a regular function, separated by commas.

lambda arg1, arg2, ... , argN: expression

Each argument is passed into the lambda function and used in the expression. When the lambda
function is called, these arguments are evaluated and the result of the expression is returned
