Lambda functions in Python are typically used in scenarios where you need a small, throwaway function for short-term use. They are commonly passed as arguments to higher-order functions (functions that take other functions as input) like:
Sorting with sorted() or sort(): When you need to sort a list based on a custom key.
Functional Programming Tools: Functions like map(), filter(), and reduce() often use lambda functions.
Event Handling: In GUI applications, lambda functions can be used for handling events.
Inline Functions: When defining a small function in-line that doesnâ€™t need to be reused.
Example Use Cases of Lambda Functions: in Prob3

Lambda functions are used when you need a small, anonymous function for a short period, especially
as arguments to higher-order functions like sorted(), map(), filter(), or reduce().
They are concise and improve readability in scenarios where defining a full function
would be overkill.
